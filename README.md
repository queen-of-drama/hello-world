# hello-world
First repository, following the GitHub tutorial.

I am learning to code by myself. Started a couple of months ago with the intention of becoming a web developer.
It's a whole new world to me, and I'm having a lot of fun.
My goals are HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
I'm quiet passionate about Python.
